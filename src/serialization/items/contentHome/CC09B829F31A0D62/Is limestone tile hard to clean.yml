        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>As with any natural stone tile, limestone tile is not difficult to clean if you take the time to do it right. That means following a regular cleaning routine, using the right techniques and opting for cleaners that are specifically formulated for use on natural stone. With these considerations addressed, the actual effort needed to clean the tiles themselves is no harder than would be required for cleaning any other flooring.
