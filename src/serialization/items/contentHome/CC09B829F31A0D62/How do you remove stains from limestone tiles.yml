        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>The first step in removing stains from limestone tile is to act as quickly as possible. The longer a spill stays on the stone, the more likely a stain is to develop and the more difficult it will be to clean.</p>
        <p>You can also work to prevent stains by ensuring your limestone tiles are properly sealed. Limestone is a natural stone material, which means it is porous and therefore absorbs liquids easily. This is what can lead to staining, if not addressed quickly.</p>
        <p>If a stain does get into the stone, you can either steam clean it or use a commercial stone cleaner designed for use on natural stone. Instructions for both of these processes can be found above in the section Deep Cleaning Limestone Floors.</p>
