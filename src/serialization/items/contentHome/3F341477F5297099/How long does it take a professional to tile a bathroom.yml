        <p>Time is money, and understanding the timeline for a professional tiling job is essential. A typical primary bathroom project can take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks to complete depending on size and complexity of the project.</p>
        <p>Factors such as the size of the project, tile type, and any unforeseen challenges can impact the duration of your project. So can the location of your bathroom; for instance, if you live in a high-rise building with an elevator, or have a bathroom on the third floor of your home, this will add time to the project as the installer will need to travel quite a distance each time they need to make a cut or get more material.</p>
