        <p>Tiling over existing tiles can be a cost-effective option, but it's essential to assess the condition of the current tiles. While it can save on demolition costs, make sure the existing surface is suitable for the new tiles to adhere properly.</p>
        <p>The tile installation will only be as strong as whatever it is attached to. That’s why its very important to make sure the tiled surface is in good shape and does not have cracked or loose tiles. Ensure the grout is not missing or cracked.</p>
        <p>Next you want to use a bonding primer for this type of installation such as the <a href="/products/superior-pro-primer-1-gallon-021605">Superior Pro-Primer</a> found here at The Tile Shop. Following the installation instructions for tile over tile application.</p>
