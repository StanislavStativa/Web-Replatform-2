        From a skills perspective, regrouting bathroom tile is an easy project. However, it is also a project that requires patience. Removing the old grout can be tedious and time-consuming, especially if you're using manual tools. Applying the new grout also requires some practice to achieve a smooth and professional finish. Having the right tools (like a high quality grout saw or oscillating multitool for removal, and a grout float for application) can make the job easier.
