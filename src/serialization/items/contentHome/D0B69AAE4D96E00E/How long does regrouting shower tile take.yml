        Regrouting shower tile can generally be done in one afternoon. A few hours will be spent removing the old grout and then about that same amount of time will be spent cleaning up, adding the new grout, and adding the finishing touches. A good rule of thumb is to expect the project to take 15 minutes per square foot. So, for example, a 16 square foot area would take 4 hours and a 32 square foot area would take 8 hours.
