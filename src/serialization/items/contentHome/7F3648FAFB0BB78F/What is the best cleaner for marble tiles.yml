        <p>The best cleaner for <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.tileshop.com/material/marble">marble tiles</a> is one that is pH-neutral and specifically designed for marble and other natural stone surfaces. Marble is sensitive to high acidity, which can cause etching and dulling. A pH-neutral cleaner ensures safe cleaning without damaging the stone.</p>
        <p>Always test any cleaning product on an inconspicuous area of the marble tile before applying it to the entire surface. This will help you check for any adverse reactions.</p>
