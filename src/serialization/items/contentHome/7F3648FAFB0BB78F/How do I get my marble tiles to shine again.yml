        <p>Getting your marble tile's original shine back is a relatively easy process. After your regular cleaning routine, use a dry microfiber cloth to buff the surface of the marble tiles. Buffing will help remove any residue and bring back a nice shine.</p>
        <p>If this does not bring back sufficient shine, you can use a commercial stone polishing product. Choose a polish specifically designed for natural stone. Apply the polish according to the manufacturer's instructions, which typically involve buffing the product onto the clean, dry surface with a soft cloth.</p>
        <p>For a DIY solution to getting your marble tiles to shine again, mix a solution of one part water and one part baking soda and spread that across the entire surface. Once the surface has been coated, remove the mixture with a mop and clean water. Gently buff the tiles until they are dry.</p>
