        <p>The best product for cleaning slate tile floors is one that has a neutral pH level. Homemade cleaning solutions that combine a few drops of dish soap and water are popular for quick cleaning jobs. For a more thorough clean, we recommend using a commercial stone cleaning product.</p>
        <p>It is important to never use an acidic cleaner on your slate tile floor. For example, many homeowners tend to think of vinegar as a universal cleaning agent. However, using vinegar on slate tiles is highly likely to cause serious damage.</p>
        <p>As with every type of material, it is always a best practice to test your cleaner on an inconspicuous area before using it on the whole surface. Always follow manufacturer instructions when using commercial cleaners.</p>
