        <p>Cutting vinyl plank flooring with a utility knife does not require a special blade. The only consideration with this method is to be sure your blade is sharp. Since installing vinyl plank flooring generally means you'll be cutting multiple planks, it is a good idea to have a few replacement blades on hand to keep your cutting clean and efficient.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">When cutting planks with a jigsaw, use a fine-toothed blade. The jigsaw blade's packaging will generally indicate what sorts of materials it is suitable for, so look for a blade that is designated for cutting vinyl planks.</p>
