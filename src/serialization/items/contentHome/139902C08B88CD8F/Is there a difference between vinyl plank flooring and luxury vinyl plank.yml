      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>Yes. While both fall under the broader category of vinyl flooring and come in plank form to mimic the look of hardwood, LVP is designed to offer a higher-end experience. Standard vinyl plank flooring is thinner and lower quality than LVP, so it is not as comfortable and will not last as long.</p>"
