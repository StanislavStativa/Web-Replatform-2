      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>The first step to protecting your investment is to seal the stone with the right sealer. Once this has been done, remember to use a PH balanced cleaner, such as Grout and Tile Neutral Cleaner and/or Anti-bacterial cleaner. Never clean with any type of acidic cleaner as this could strip the sealer over time. Acid can also etch polished natural stone. We also suggest using these neutral products to maintain the grout joints on any ceramic, porcelain, or glass tiles.</p>"
