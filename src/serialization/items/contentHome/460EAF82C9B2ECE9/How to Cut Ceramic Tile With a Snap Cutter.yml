        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>The techniques for cutting ceramic tile with a snap cutter and cutting porcelain tile with a snap cutter are nearly identical. When you’re cutting either of these materials, you’ll clearly hear the scoring. You’ll want to use nice, even pressure all the way through on the cut.  </p>
        <br />
        <p>Both porcelain and ceramic cut beautifully on the snap cutter. Because of its relative softness, ceramic tile will only require slight downward pressure after the score has been made for the tile to snap. <a class="font-bold" href="/material/porcelain">Porcelain tile</a> is harder and might require more strength to snap along the score line. </p>
