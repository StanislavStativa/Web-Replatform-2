        <p>As we mentioned above when discussing how to cut glass tile with a wet saw, glass is a very difficult material to work with, especially when cutting. It’s crucial to go very slowly and provide consistent pressure.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Our pros recommend making a very light score line when cutting glass tile, because pressing too hard will crack the tile in half. That means that you might not hear the score as you would if you were cutting ceramic or porcelain. The score line will still show up as the cutting wheel runs across the top of the tile.</p>
