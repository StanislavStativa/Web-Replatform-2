        The two most common types of adhesives used for backsplash tiles are thin-set mortar and mastic. The best adhesive for your backsplash will depend on the type of tiles you're using and the specific conditions of your kitchen.<br />
        <br />
        Thin-set mortar is best for areas with lots of exposure to moisture. It's also good for larger tiles that need a stronger bond to stay in place. This type of adhesive can be used for ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tiles.<br />
        <br />
        Mastic is a good choice for backsplashes where heavy moisture exposure is not a concern. This type of adhesive is less common in kitchen backsplashes, but for areas that are unlikely to experience regular exposure to moisture it can be a suitable option.<br />
        <br />
        As always, your best bet is to follow the tile manufacturer's instructions when selecting an adhesive.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tileshop.com/installation-care/installation/adhesives">Shop all adhesives &gt;</a>
