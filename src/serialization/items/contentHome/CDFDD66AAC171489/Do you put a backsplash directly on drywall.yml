        Yes, it is possible to put a tile backsplash directly on drywall if the area is not regularly exposed to high levels of moisture. Drywall provides a smooth, stable surface that is suitable for tile adhesive. The drywall must be clean, dry, and in good condition.<br />
        <br />
        For the purposes of a tile backsplash, behind a sink is usually not considered a high moisture area. However, backsplashes in highly wet areas like showers need a backer board for waterproofing and stability. Drywall alone cannot withstand continuous moisture exposure, even when it is behind tile.
