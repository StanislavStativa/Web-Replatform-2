        <div class="rich-text">
        The cost to install a kitchen backsplash will mostly depend on the type of tiles you use, as well as the total square footage of the backsplash area. Kitchen backsplash tile costs can range from $25 to $150 per square foot, with a few options that cost more and a few that cost less.<br />
        <br />
        For all other materials, including grout, adhesive, and tools, you can expect to spend between $200 and $300.
