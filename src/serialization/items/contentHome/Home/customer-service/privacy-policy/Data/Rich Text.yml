        Your browser may have some features for limited control of cookies. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies, but browser settings may not control flash cookies. To control flash cookies, click here. Your mobile device may not give you the ability to control cookies. To block cookies on mobile applications, you need to delete the application from your mobile device.
