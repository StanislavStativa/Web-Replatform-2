      Hint: Description
      Value: "There are many benefits to installing tile. Ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tiles that have been properly sealed have a much longer life cycle and are much easier to clean and maintain overtime than many other flooring options. Tile is also hypoallergenic so it won't collect bacteria, mold, or germs like other flooring. Call our Tile Experts at 888-398-6595 to learn more."
