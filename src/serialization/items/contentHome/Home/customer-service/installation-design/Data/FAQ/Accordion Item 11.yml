      Hint: Description
      Value: "The difference between sanded and unsanded grout is silica sand. The sand acts as a filler and adds strength for application in grout joints larger than 1/8 inch. Unsanded grout is for grout joints 1/8 or smaller. The width of your grout joint will determine what grout should be used. Both sanded and unsanded will work in 1/8 grout joints. Suggested grout and finish may be contingent upon material type, such as polished marble, travertine and glass. Please contact our Tile Experts at 888-398-6595 for additional questions."
