        <p>Each tile project is unique and will depend on a few different things: the product being used, the space where the product is being installed, and how much time was spent on prep &amp; layout. The Tile Shop offers assistance through <a href="/resources/installation-videos-and-guides">installation guides</a>, <a href="/resources/installation-videos-and-guides">how-to videos</a>, and FREE DIY seminars hosted every Saturday in each of our stores. Speak with a Tile Shop representative or our Customer Service team at 888-398-6595 if you have any additional questions.</p>
