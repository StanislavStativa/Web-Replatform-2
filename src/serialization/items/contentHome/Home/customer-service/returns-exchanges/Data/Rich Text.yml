        <strong>General Information</strong></p><br />
        <div class="rich-text">
        <ul>
            <li>A refund will be issued for active* products returned in original packaging and good sellable condition within sixty (60) days of pickup or shipment date. Field tile must be returned in original factory boxes and in full-box quantities only, unless sold as a sample.</li>
            <li>The Tile Shop sells products that are either a natural stone cut from a quarry, a clay tile or another material that is processed and manufactured to achieve certain colors and textures.</li>
            <li>Stone is a natural product subject to variations in size, color, shade, veining, texture and polish. These variations are what make natural stone unique. All stone samples are provided by the manufacturer and are intended to convey the characteristics of a certain type of stone, but variations will occur, and the product&rsquo;s conformity to a sample is not assured.</li>
            <li>Although manufactured tiles may be more uniform, variations in color and texture can still occur, and the color of any sample may differ from the current product offering.</li>
            <li>The coverages displayed are approximate, and product specifications are not guaranteed.</li>   
        </ul>
        </div> <br />
        <p><span>*<em>An active product is any SKU that is not discontinued in our system, is not a Special Order item, or is not a freight charge.</em></span></p><br />
