        <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you have already placed your order you will need to contact a Tile Shop representative to change your shipment address. Any changes made to the provided shipping address once your order is in route will result in additional freight fees that are the sole responsibility of the customer--this includes requesting the material being shipped to a local store after the material has already been shipped. Please contact Customer Service for more details.</span></p>
