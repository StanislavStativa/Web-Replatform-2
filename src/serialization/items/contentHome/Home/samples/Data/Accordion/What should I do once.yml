        <p>First, bring your sample into the space where it&rsquo;s going to be used. For example, bring a bathroom tile sample into your bathroom, and think about how it fits with the overall style of the space you&rsquo;re trying to create. Check back often so you can see how your samples look throughout the day under different types of light.</p>
        <p>Next, see how a sample looks with other elements in the room:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have ordered backsplash tile samples, how do they look paired with your cabinets and counters?&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Place floor tile samples on the ground, and see if you like how they look with your baseboards, door frames and more.</li>
            <li>Consider whether your wall tile samples&nbsp;will work with your existing paint colors, or if you should test swatches of wall paint before completing your tile purchase.</li>
        </ul>
