        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2">The Textured Luxury of Architectural Tile</span></h2>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Architectural tiles go beyond the purely functional and become an integral part of a space's aesthetic and architectural design. They are often statement pieces used to create a bold landscape with dramatic shadows and other 3-D effects.</p>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">In addition to their textural beauty, these tiles can help guide the landscape of your home. For example, going from a flat wall to architectural tile can provide visual separation between your kitchen and your living room by changing the very texture of the wall, rather than simply shifting from one color to another.</p></div>
