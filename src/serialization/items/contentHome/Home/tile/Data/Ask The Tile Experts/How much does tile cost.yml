        <p>The selection of materials, difference in room sizes and other options available for tile mean that costs vary widely from project to project. While it will sometimes be a larger initial cost, a tile floor lasts longer and wears better than many other flooring types, like carpet or wood, which means it’s a better long-term investment. Tile floors also have a high resale value which is important to consider if there’s a chance you’ll be moving in the future. The best way to estimate the cost of your project is to schedule a design consultation with an in-store associate who will guide you along the process. Whatever your project goals are, The Tile Shop has a way to achieve them.</p>
