        <p>There really is no standard size for wall and floor tiles. They range from small tiles and mosaics, made up of even smaller tiles, to large-format tiles, which means at least one side of the tile is over 16” long. The size is up to you and what looks best in your space. If you don’t know where to start, make a design consultation appointment, and stop into The Tile Shop to get some expert advice.</p>
