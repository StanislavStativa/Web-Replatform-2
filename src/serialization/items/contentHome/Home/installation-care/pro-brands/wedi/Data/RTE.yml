        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wedi shower systems are designed to provide a high-quality, water-tight solution for building custom tiled showers. These systems are popular among both DIY enthusiasts and professional contractors due to their reliability and ease of installation.</p>
        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2">Why Our Customers Love Wedi Shower Systems</span></h2>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Fully Customizable</span></h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wedi systems can be used to create showers of various shapes and sizes, including custom designs. They offer a range of pre-formed components like shower bases, wall panels, wall niches and benches, all of which integrate seamlessly with each other.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">For custom shower layouts, you can easily cut Wedi panels to size with a utility knife. This enables quick customization and fitting at the point of installation, rather than needing to use specialized machinery off site.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Easy to Install</span></h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">The system is designed for quick and easy installation. Wedi panels are made from a light, extruded polystyrene foam core, which is significantly lighter than traditional cement backer boards or mortar beds. This makes handling and cutting the materials much easier, especially in confined spaces like bathrooms.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wedi also offers all-in-one shower kits, which include everything you need to install a fully waterproof shower that is ready for tiling. These shower kits come with a Wedi shower pan, Wedi wall boards, Click and Seal drains, prefabricated shower niches and all the tools and materials needed to seal and waterproof the components.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wedi shower bases should be installed directly onto subflooring. It is not recommended to install shower bases over tile, cement or other flooring material.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Fully Waterproof</span></h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">All Wedi panels are designed to be interlocking, which provides exceptional waterproofing. The XPS foam core is also mold-proof, so you won't have to worry about mold growth in your shower.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">All of this waterproofing means there&rsquo;s no need to apply a separate waterproof membrane over the substrate. This eliminates several steps in the shower installation process, reducing both time and potential for error.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Built for Tile</span></h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wedi shower panels are covered with a cement-based resin coating. This coating provides an ideal bonding surface for <a href="/material/porcelain" class="font-bold underline">porcelain</a>, ceramic, stone and many other types of tile. There is no additional prep work needed; the tile can be installed directly onto any Wedi board.</p>
