        <div class="rich-text"><p style="margin-bottom:0.67em;">Caulk for use on tiled areas comes in two varieties: sanded and unsanded. Knowing which to use will ensure the seal you create will be durable and long lasting.</p><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Silicone Caulk</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Silicone caulk is the go-to choice for waterproofing gaps around showers, tubs, sinks, countertops, and other areas exposed to moisture. It offers flexibility and strong adhesion, allowing it to create a watertight seal that expands and contracts with temperature changes.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">This elasticity helps prevent cracks that could lead to leaks and the heat tolerance means it can be exposed to direct sunlight without breaking down. The watertight seal also resists mold and mildew growth, making it the ideal caulk for bathroom tile or for any other high moisture environments.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;" /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Sanded Caulk</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Sanded caulk mimics the texture of sanded grout. This makes it a good option for sealing around trim, baseboards, and other areas where you might want to create a watertight seal that you can paint over for a finished look.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">A good rule of thumb is that sanded caulk can be used anywhere you would use sanded grout. That means you can use it for filling gaps between tiles of 1/8" or more between. This helps in achieving a seamless visual transition between the caulk and grout lines. Sanded caulk also boasts resistance to the growth of mold, mildew, fungus, algae and bacteria.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;" /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Easy Color Matching</h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;;margin-bottom:0.67em">Both sanded and silicone caulk come in a variety of colors to help you match your <a href="/installation-care/installation/grout/colors" class="font-bold underline">grout color</a>. From Brilliant White to London Fog to Black Licorice, you will be able to closely color match your grout for a seamless look.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em;" "="" /><h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">We're Here to Help</h3><p>Choosing the right caulk for your project is the first step in ensuring you get the results you want.
