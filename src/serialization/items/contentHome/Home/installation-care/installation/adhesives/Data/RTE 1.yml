        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Tile adhesives all serve the same purpose, but different environments and types of tile will require different varieties of adhesive. For example, a shower tile adhesive will require different properties compared to a living room wall tile adhesive. However, you will likely be choosing between one of three types of tile adhesive.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Thinset</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Thinset is highly resistant to moisture, making it suitable for areas like kitchens, showers, and even <a href="/application/pool" class="font-bold">swimming pools</a>. Modified thinsets offer enhanced flexibility, making them suitable for areas with slight movements or temperature fluctuations, such as heated floors or exteriors. This makes it a popular choice as stone, porcelain, and ceramic tile adhesive because it provides excellent adhesion.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Mastic</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Mastic is a pre-mixed, paste-like adhesive made from organic compounds. It's ready to use straight from the container. However, unlike thinset, mastic is not water resistant and therefore should only be used indoors in dry environments. Still, mastic can be easier to use than thinset since it does not require mixing and is generally easier to apply.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wood Flooring Adhesive</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Wood floor tile adhesive is specially formulated to adhere to most types of wood flooring, including natural, manufactured, bamboo and many others. This type of adhesive provides the elasticity needed for wood flooring, keeping firm adhesion while the wood naturally expands and contracts. High quality wood flooring adhesives will also contribute to noise reduction and water resistance.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">White vs. Gray</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Tile adhesives may come in white or gray variants. While the color itself isn't usually the most critical factor for bond strength, it's important to consider how the adhesive's color might affect the aesthetics of your project.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">When using light-colored tiles or grout, white thinset mortar is preferred to avoid any gray adhesive showing through the grout lines and disrupting the clean look. Conversely, with darker tiles or grout, gray thinset mortar might be a better choice for a seamless appearance.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin">In most cases, choosing the adhesive based on its functional suitability for your project is the top priority.</p>
