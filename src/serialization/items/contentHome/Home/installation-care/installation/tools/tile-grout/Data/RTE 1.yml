        <div class="rich-text"><p style="margin-bottom:0.67em;">Using the right grout application tools and grout finishing tools is necessary for achieving a high quality, clean, and durable grout installation. If you opt to use non-specialized tools, you may end up with uneven grout density or gaps in the grout, which can weaken the entire tile surface.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0.67em;">Proper tile grout tools can also significantly speed up the grouting process while at the same time reducing the physical effort involved. For example, grout floats are designed to reduce hand and arm fatigue, allowing you to work faster and longer without feeling fatigued.</p><p>More importantly, well-applied grout using the correct tools will last longer and be easier to clean and maintain. This is because properly filled and sealed grout lines are less likely to allow moisture, mildew and debris to penetrate the tile surface.</p><h2 style="margin-bottom:0.67em;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2">Tools for Grouting</span></h2><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Grout Float</span></h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">A grout float is a specialized tool used in tile installation to apply and press grout into the joints between tiles. Floats come in various shapes and sizes to accommodate different tile sizes, joint widths, and personal preferences. Larger floats can cover more area, making them a good choice for projects that use bigger tiles with bigger grout lines. Smaller floats offer more precision and control, which is especially helpful for smaller tiles and mosaics.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Grouting Sponge</span></h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;">As you apply grout with a float, a damp sponge is needed to wipe away excess grout from the surface of the tiles. Doing this as you work will help with shaping the grout lines and keeping the tile clean. Grouting sponges are usually made from hydrophilic materials that are highly absorbent yet firm enough to maintain their shape.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Grout Joint Sealer Brush</span></h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">This tool is specifically designed for applying sealer to the thin grout lines between tiles. This brush is typically small and narrow, enabling precise application of the sealer without excessive spillage or waste. Using a brush like this helps ensure that the sealer is evenly distributed over the grout lines, providing effective protection against moisture, stains, and bacterial growth.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" /><h2 style="margin-bottom:0.67em;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2-style">We're Here to Help</span></h2><p>The Tile Shop has all the tools you need to install grout easily with professional-looking results.
