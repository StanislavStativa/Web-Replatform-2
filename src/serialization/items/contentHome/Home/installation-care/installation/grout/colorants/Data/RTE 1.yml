        <div class="rich-text"><p>Grout colorant allows you to freshen, enhance or totally change the color of your grout. Grout colorant will often also act as a sealant, which means there is no need to buy a separate grout colorant sealer. A combination grout colorant and sealer will allow you to refresh and reinforce your grout in the same process, beautifying and strengthening it for many years.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0.67em;">Grout colorant can easily be applied at home. Follow these instructions to get started.</p><h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2">How to Apply Grout Colorant</span></h2><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Cleaning</span></h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Allow new grout to cure for at least 48 hours before applying the colorant. For old grout, deep clean it using a grout cleaner or a vinegar solution. Rinse thoroughly and let dry for 24 hours.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Lightly etch the grout with an acidic etching product to improve colorant adhesion. Rinse again and let dry completely.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Note: Using vinegar or acidic cleaners on polished natural stone can remove the polished finish and permanently affect the look of this tile.</em></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em></em></p><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><em><span class="h3">Application</span></em></h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Always wear utility gloves when applying colorant and avoid skin contact. If contact occurs, wash the affected area with soap and water. Before applying the colorant to the full surface, test it in an inconspicuous spot.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Use a grout brush to scrub the joints clean, then rinse and dry completely. Colorant should always be applied to freshly cleaned grout.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Using a poly brush, apply the colorant to the grout joint using a back-and-forth motion to work it deeply into the surface. For the best results, apply a second coat of colorant after two to four hours.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;" /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Drying and Curing</span></h3><p style="margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom:0.67em">Colorant will dry tack-free in about 30 minutes and will be ready for light foot traffic after two hours. The surface will be ready for normal foot traffic after 24 hours and heavy foot traffic after 72 hours. Avoid scrubbing the grout joints for 20 days to allow the colorant to fully cure.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;" /><h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2">We're Here to Help</span></h2><p>Not sure whether to keep the same color or switch things up?
