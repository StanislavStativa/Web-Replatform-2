        <p>The sheer variety of options available for your fireplace tile surround makes it possible to find the perfect combination of design and material that will both make a statement and fit with your unique personal style.</p>
        <p>Whether you have a gas or a traditional fireplace, there is a decorative tile solution that can add a stylish tone to your décor. If you live an older home, consider installing tile over brick fireplaces to create a dramatic new look. Tile is a very durable and easy-to-clean surface that is also completely fire-safe, meaning you won’t have the flammability worries that you might find with other materials.</p></div>
