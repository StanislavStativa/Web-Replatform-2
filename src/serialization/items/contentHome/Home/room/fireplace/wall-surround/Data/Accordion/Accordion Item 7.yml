      Hint: Description
      Value: <p>No. Usually you want to remove your old façade and get to a flat wall before tiling, so it shouldn’t matter which year it was built. There are some instances where you can tile over tile, but everyone’s fireplace is a little different. Speak with an expert sales associate so they can walk you through the installation process.</p>
