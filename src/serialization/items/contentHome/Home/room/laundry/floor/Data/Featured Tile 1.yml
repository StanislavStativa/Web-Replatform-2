        <div class="rich-text"><p>A beautiful range of floor tile choices makes it possible to find the perfect combination of function and design for your laundry room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are just a few of the many ways to shop for laundry room floor tile to narrow down all the options to find the right choice for you:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>• <strong>Color and Pattern</strong>: Laundry is a fact of life, but laundry day is a little less of a chore when you enjoy your space. So have fun with color and pattern—boring laundry rooms are a thing of the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>• <strong>Material</strong>: In rooms with very specific functions, like laundry rooms, choosing tile made from a durable material is important. Manmade materials like <a href="/material/porcelain" class="font-bold">porcelain</a>, ceramic and cement will all hold up to years of heavy use, especially in multi-tasking spaces, like laundry room located in entryways. And advances in porcelain tile design mean you can even achieve the look of real wood in a water-resistant material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>• <strong>Size</strong>: <a href="/featured/large-format" class="font-bold">Large-format pieces</a> are a popular tile for a laundry room. In addition to making a space feel larger, a floor will also have fewer grout lines, which can simplify cleaning and maintenance over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>• <strong>Shop by shape</strong>: Many floor tile shapes are suited to laundry rooms, including rectangular, square, <a href="/shape/hexagon" class="font-bold">hexagonal </a>and geometric. Choose from individual field tiles and expertly designed mosaics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>• <strong>Shop by pattern</strong>: Coordinate your laundry room with your overall home décor with tiles featuring subtle textural designs, intricate florals, bold geometric accents and more.</p></div>
