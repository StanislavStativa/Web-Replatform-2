        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consider the size and layout of your laundry room when selecting tiles. <a href="/featured/large-format" class="font-bold underline">Larger tiles</a> can make a small room appear more spacious, but they may require cutting to fit around appliances and fixtures. Smaller tiles can offer more flexibility in terms of layout and can be a good choice for irregularly shaped rooms.</p><p>Select durable tiles that can withstand the weight of your washer and dryer, as well as resist wear and tear over time. <a href="/material/porcelain" class="font-bold underline">Porcelain tiles</a> are known for their strength and durability, making them a mainstay of <a href="/inspiration/tile-ideas/laundry-room" class="font-bold underline">laundry room floor design</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Laundry Room Backsplash</span></h3><p>Adding a <a href="/application/backsplash" class="font-bold underline">tile backsplash</a> to your laundry room is a fun way to experiment with interesting colors and patterns. The smaller overall square footage of a backsplash means you can add some whimsy or intrigue on a smaller scale, keeping busy patterns or vibrant colors from overwhelming the room.</p><p>As for color, while the conventional wisdom says dark walls can make a small space feel even smaller, that is not always the case with laundry room tiles. If your laundry room is especially well lit, consider a high gloss black tile for your laundry room backsplash. The gloss will reduce the darkening effect and the stark <a href="/color/black" class="font-bold underline">black tile</a> will add a dramatic flare to an otherwise purely functional room.</p>
