        <p>
        There is a shower tile floor for every budget. Tile costs vary widely, ranging from budget-friendly ceramic and porcelain tiles up to the highest-end marble and detailed mosaics, not to mention that a small shower enclosure will require less tile and cost less than a large walk-in shower. For budget projects, we recommend featuring a more expensive tile, such as a marble mosaic, on your shower pan floor or as an accent on the shower wall. This will help give you a high-end look for less.
