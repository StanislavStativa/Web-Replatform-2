        <p>Everyone loves a good before-and-after moment, and installing a tile bar backsplash is an easy way to achieve that “big reveal” feeling without signing up for a major home renovation. Usually, a home bar area is smaller than a kitchen, which is great news if you find yourself drawn to luxury or designer finishes (such as <a href="/featured/mosaics/waterjet-mosaics" class="font-bold">waterjet marble mosaics</a> with metallic detail, or gleaming white marble). With fewer square feet of backsplash to cover, you might be able to consider those higher price-point pieces that would be outside your budget in a larger space.</p></div>
