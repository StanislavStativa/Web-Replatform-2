        <h2 class="md:leading-48 text-2xl md:text-40 extra-small-bottom-margin">Create Your Ideal Entertaining Space with Bar Tiles</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re hosting a big holiday gathering you’ve been planning for months, or an impromptu get-together with a few friends, you’ll always be ready to welcome others into your home when you feel equipped for entertaining.</p><p>In addition to looking great, finishing your home bar areas creates a dedicated space in your house for social gatherings and protects walls and floors from spills and other wear and tear. (Don’t have a home bar area with counters or a sink? No problem. Consider adding a tile accent wall and add a bar cabinet or cart in front of it to create a similar effect with style to spare.)</p><p>From rustic <a href="/featured/wood-look" class="font-bold">wood-look tile</a> that sets a casual vibe, to glamourous gold mirrored tile that creates an inviting glow, to classic <a href="/featured/subway" class="font-bold">white subway tile</a> that goes with any décor, you can choose from our wide selection of bar tiles to create the space that’s just right for your lifestyle.</p></div>
