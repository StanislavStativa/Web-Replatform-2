        <div class="rich-text"><p>•<strong> Shop by material</strong>: In high-traffic areas like entryways, installing a durable material is equally as important as appearance. Choose from materials that will hold up to years of heavy use, from manmade materials like cement, ceramic or porcelain entryway tiles, or natural stone entryway floor tile in like marble, limestone and <a href="/material/travertine/floor" class="font-bold">travertine</a>.</p><p>• <strong>Shop by color</strong>: A bright pop of color right inside your front or back door can make a functional space like a foyer or mudroom feel special.</p><p>• <strong>Shop by shape</strong>: From individual field tiles to expertly designed mosaics, there are many <a href="/application/floor" class="font-bold">floor tile</a> shapes that work well in entryways, including rectangular, square, hexagonal and geometric.</p><p>• <strong>Shop by size</strong>: Large-format entryway and foyer floor tiles are popular because they have a widening effect that makes the space feel larger. And with fewer grout lines, <a href="/featured/large-format" class="font-bold">large-format tiles</a> can simplify cleaning and maintenance, too.</p><p>• <strong>Shop by pattern</strong>: Coordinate your entryway with your overall home décor with tiles featuring subtle textural designs, intricate florals, bold geometric accents and more.</p></div>
