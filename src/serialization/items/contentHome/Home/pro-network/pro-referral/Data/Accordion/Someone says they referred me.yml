        <p>If you believe there has been an error regarding a potential referral order, start by reviewing the following: &#x2028</p>
        <p>Did the person provide your Tile Shop Customer ID number when placing their order? </p>
        <p>Are you registered with PaymentWorks? </p>
        <p>Has it been more than 30 days since the order was placed? </p>
         <p />
        <p>If you answered “yes” to all three questions above, please reach out to Tile Shop Customer Service at 888-398-6595 for assistance. For faster service, have the order number and your CID ready when you call.</p>
