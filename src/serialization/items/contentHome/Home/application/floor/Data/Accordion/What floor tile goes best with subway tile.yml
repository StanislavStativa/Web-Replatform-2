      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>Since subway tile is a simple and timeless choice, it can be paired with almost anything on the floor. Feel free to opt for a patterned tile or a bold color to offset a white subway tile. You might choose to create a modern farmhouse space and use a wood-look tile on the floor. Or perhaps you want to elevate your subway tile by installing a marble floor. The options are endless, and simply depend on the style you want to achieve.</p>"
