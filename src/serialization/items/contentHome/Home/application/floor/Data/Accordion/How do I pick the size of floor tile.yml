      Hint: Description
      Value: <p>Start with the size of your space. A very large tile may be too big for a small space and vice versa, so it’s important to get the scale right. Larger tiles can also make a space feel bigger, creating an optical illusion in your favor. You may also want to consider your other tiles in the space. It can be a fun design choice to play with contrast between wall and floor tile sizes. Installing your tile in a unique pattern is another way to add interest and personality. Beyond that, you can choose whatever size and style speak to you.</p>
