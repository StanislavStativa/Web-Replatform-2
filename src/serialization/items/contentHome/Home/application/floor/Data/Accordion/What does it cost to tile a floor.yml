      Hint: Description
      Value: <p>Every tile project is different, so the cost can and will vary widely. The cost of your floor depends on the size of your space, the material, the style and size of tile, if you’re installing the tile yourself and numerous other factors. Bring measurements for your space and any inspiration into one of our stores, and talk to a store associate about your options. They’ll be able to work with you and help you get a beautiful tile floor in your price range.</p>
