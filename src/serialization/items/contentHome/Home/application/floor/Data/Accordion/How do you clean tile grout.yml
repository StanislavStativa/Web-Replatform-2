        <p>Grout that is sealed should also be regularly cleaned to maintain its appearance. We recommend our <a href="/products/superior-grout-and-tile-neutral-cleaner-1-quart-021650" class="font-bold">Superior Grout &amp; Tile Neutral Cleaner</a> for everyday maintenance because it is pH neutral and nonacidic which means it is gentle enough to use on your grout daily. For deeper cleaning needs, ask a store associate for a recommendation.</p>
