        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Different Styles of Pool Tile</h3>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span>Our selection of pool-rated tiles includes something for every aesthetic. We offer minimalist and modern pool tile for those looking to create a spa-like environment at home, as well as many shades of glass pool tile that amplifies water’s movement and light.

        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">About Pool Tile Materials</h3>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">In order to be suitable for use in a pool, tile must be “pool-rated.” At The Tile Shop, the majority of our current selection of pool-rated tile is made with glass. Porcelain tile can be pool-rated, but it is on a case-by-case basis depending on factors like that particular tile’s water absorption, fading, chemical resistance, etc. The good news is that product included in our Pool Tile selection has been rated for use in pools, so you can shop porcelain pool tile with confidence. And we are constantly expanding our product offerings in this category, so check back often to see the newest arrivals.&nbsp;</p>
