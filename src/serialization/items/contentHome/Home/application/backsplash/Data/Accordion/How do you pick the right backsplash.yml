      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>This is where your personal style and taste come into play. You can choose to coordinate your tile with your cabinets and countertops or you can choose to contrast them. Your backsplash can be the attention-getting centerpiece of your room or it can be subtler to let other design elements shine. The key is not having too many focal points in a room at once. Prioritize your favorite elements and let the rest serve to make those elements look good. If you choose to feature your backsplash, the sky’s the limit. Unique colors, materials and shapes can all be utilized here.</p>"
