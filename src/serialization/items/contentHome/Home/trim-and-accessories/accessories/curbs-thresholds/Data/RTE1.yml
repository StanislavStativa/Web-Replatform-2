        <div class="richText-max rich-text"><h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Create a Finished Look with Tile Curbs and Thresholds</h2><p>Whether you need to create a transition from tile to a door threshold or between different flooring materials going from room to room, a tile curb or tile threshold strip is vital. These endcap pieces are specifically designed to smooth the edges of  <a href="/application/floor" class="font-bold">tile flooring</a> to protect the tile and those walking on it. </p><h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Why You Need Tile Threshold Strips</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 class="small-right-padding small-left-padding extra-small-bottom-margin">Edge Protection</h4> <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="small-right-padding small-left-padding"><a href="/resources/how-to/how-to-fix-chipped-or-cracked-tile" class="font-bold">Tile can be chipped or cracked</a> if its edges face a lot of foot traffic or if they are bumped by heavy objects. Threshold strips help to protect the edges of your tile from damage by  <a href="/resources/how-to/top-ways-to-finish-tile-edges" class="font-bold">creating a finished edge</a> that brings the tile's natural durability flush with the other flooring material. By covering the edges, you can greatly improve the durability of your flooring.
          </p><h4 class="small-right-padding small-left-padding extra-small-bottom-margin">Height difference adjustment</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="small-right-padding small-left-padding">Different flooring materials often have different thicknesses. Threshold strips can help bridge these height differences, making the transition between spaces seamless and reducing tripping hazards.</p><p class="small-right-padding small-left-padding">Installing a threshold for carpet to tile or hardwood to tile makes the transition between flooring materials smoother. This is especially important because it may be difficult to notice the transition when walking, potentially resulting in tripping or feet scraping on the tile's edge. A threshold strip smooths that rough edge, providing extra comfort and safety.</p><h4 class="small-right-padding small-left-padding extra-small-bottom-margin">Water barrier</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="small-right-padding small-left-padding">In showers, it's important to create a finished tile shower threshold. An unfinished tile threshold will allow water to get between the tile and the underlayment, creating the perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow.</p><p class="small-right-padding small-left-padding">You may also have a raised barrier that separates the shower area from the rest of the bathroom, known as a shower curb. The shower curb prevents water from spilling out onto the bathroom floor. You can install shower curb tile that matches the rest of the tile in your shower, or you can use this opportunity to bring in design elements from elsewhere in the bathroom to act as an accent.</p><h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">We're Here to Help</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's no better way to ensure you have the best curb or threshold for your shower than to consult with an expert.
