        This rectangular shape comes in a variety of materials and finishes, making it a versatile choice for walls and floors. Larger tile shapes like this have fewer grout lines to maintain and can make your room look bigger, more open and less busy. Some people even use 12&rdquo; x 24&rdquo; tiles throughout their whole space, breaking up the look with added decorative touches like an eye-level stripe or a decorative threshold tile. 12&rdquo; x 24&rdquo; tiles have become even more popular than 12&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; tiles because of the increased ease in maintenance. Plus, they are available in a large variety of finishes and colors, satisfying decorative styles from contemporary to rustic.
