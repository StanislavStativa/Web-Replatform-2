      Hint: Description
      Value: "From eye-catching to subtle, installing an attractive tile design can turn your walls into a work of art. A border or listello with a burst of pattern and color will draw the eye and add an engaging, decorative element to your home. Consider creating an accent or feature wall to draw attention in a room, whether it&rsquo;s your fireplace surround, behind your bed&rsquo;s headboard or where your TV is mounted. Your shower area is an opportunity to showcase an interesting tile layout that will create a vibe that&rsquo;s lively and welcoming. Our selection of architectural tile has a variety of textures and even 3-D effects that are a perfect way to inject some life into your wall patterns, no matter which room you&rsquo;re working on in your home."
