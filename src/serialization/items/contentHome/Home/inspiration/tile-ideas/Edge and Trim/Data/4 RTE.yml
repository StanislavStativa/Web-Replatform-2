        <h1 class="lato-h1 mb-8">Design Tip: Choosing Materials</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">
        For edging purposes, a combination of materials can be mixed and matched to create a rich sense of depth in your room. Get creative with contrast by pairing ceramic and glass or installing glass tile with stone accents. Natural stones, like marble, granite and travertine, can be polished so that the edges appear finished. Pencil wall tile is a classic accent piece that helps produce an even tone for easy matching. Metal edge trim is a quickly growing trend that&rsquo;s available in a wide array of styles and finishes. Use metal trim in your bathroom to create a clean and contemporary transition to another surface that also matches the finish of your sink faucet or shower head. If you&rsquo;re installing subway tile, turn your tile vertically to create a defined edge at the top or border. Any questions? Learn more about edging from our experienced store associates at The Tile Shop.
