        <p class="mb-4">
        It&rsquo;s important to make sure that you&rsquo;re ending your wall and backsplash tile at the right spot because installing tile where the edge is visible will leave your project looking unfinished. A smooth, rounded bullnose edge is a great way to give your tile a clean finish and streamlined look. Since it&rsquo;s far less likely to chip or break, bullnoses add increased durability to your tiled areas. Used at the top of a shower wall or kitchen backsplash, rounded tiles can provide a smooth transition and a clean, polished appearance. Trim can also add framing effects, arch features or distinctive ending points like chair rail molding to your wall. Add elegance to your space by ending with skirting at the floor or a chair rail piece at wainscot height. From marble to ceramic, these pieces come in a wide variety of finishes.
