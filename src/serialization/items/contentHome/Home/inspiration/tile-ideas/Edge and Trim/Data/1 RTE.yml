        <p class="mb-4">
        After investing a lot of thought into a room&rsquo;s tile design, many homeowners overlook how critical it is to properly finish the edges of their tile project. By removing the exposed edges, trim softens the transition where your tile ends, adding a high-end look and effectively outlining your tile installation. But trim pieces are also an important design feature. <a class="font-bold underline" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/blog/guide-to-tile-trim-and-profiles/" target="_blank">Layering</a> trim tiles can elevate the entire design, accent a certain feature and create interest and individuality. These borders, trims and accent tiles can seamlessly blend into your design, stand out or highlight another feature in the space by repeating a finish or material. Keep in mind how the finer details of your project can impact the look and feel of the room.
