        <h2 class="lato-h1 mb-8">Tile Sizes & Shapes</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">From traditional to truly unique, floor tile is available in all shapes and sizes these days. The tried-and-true 12&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; tiles are still popular, but tiles are tending to be larger and larger. Sizes like 16&rdquo; x 16&rdquo;, 12&rdquo; x 24&rdquo; and even 24&rdquo; x 48&rdquo; are becoming more prevalent. Large-format tiles have fewer grout lines to clean and help a room look bigger, more open and less busy. Tile thickness is moving in the opposite direction as consumers are leaning towards thinner options. We&rsquo;re also seeing plenty of fun geometric shapes become more popular, like large hexagon designs. A new wave of millennial homeowners has led to a rise in herringbone, chevron and mixed-width patterns.</p>
