        From modern to rustic, tile flooring is well suited to fit your personal interior design style. Traditionally, stone flooring has been a durable, time-tested design element. Keep in mind that a material you choose can lend itself to multiple design styles. For example, large-format grey slate can give you a contemporary Nordic vibe, whereas slate with hints of orange and beige can lean warm and rustic. Given the variety of textures and colors available in porcelain and ceramic tile, it is an exceptional choice for modern homes. When aiming for a rustic feel for your home, focus on elements that add a cozy vibe. Installing natural stone or wood-look tile flooring is effective in adding warm tones to your space. If you&rsquo;re aiming for farmhouse style, faux-wood flooring is always appropriate, but there are plenty of other tile options, like black and white patterns, that can work well with a comfortable, lived-in look.
