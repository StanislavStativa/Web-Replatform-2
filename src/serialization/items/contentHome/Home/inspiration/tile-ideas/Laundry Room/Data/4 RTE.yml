        <h2 class="lato-h1 mb-8">Design Tip: Choosing Materials</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
        Ceramic, porcelain, marble, glass, travertine&hellip;when there are so many options, it can be hard to know what tile material to choose. Man-made tiles, like porcelain and ceramic, are not only durable, but they come in an almost-endless selection. Different colors, shapes and finishes mean that there is always a perfect tile for your project. Stone tiles also offer a large variety of naturally occurring variations but have different care properties. There&rsquo;s no one perfect tile for everyone&mdash;it just depends on the look you want to achieve. The Tile Shop has a large selection of tiles that&rsquo;s growing everyday, so there&rsquo;s always something new to discover.
