        Laundry room backsplashes are becoming quite popular because it&rsquo;s a place to show your personality and brighten up the space (and maybe even make doing the laundry a little more fun!). Since it is usually separate from the rest of your house, many people use their laundry room backsplash tile to add a bright color or pattern, like with encaustic or encaustic-look tiles, interesting mosaic or something bolder than they&rsquo;d normally use in the rest of the house. Hexagons, arabesques, 3-D tiles and mosaics all work perfectly to serve as a backsplash and accent.
