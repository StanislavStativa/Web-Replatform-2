      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>When properly maintained, the sealer should have a lifespan similar to what is stated on the label, however, this will vary depending on the traffic and use of the space where the tile is installed. For a general idea, Premium Gold and Enhance &amp; Seal can last up to 15 years with proper care. The easiest way to determine if your stone or grout needs to be re-sealed is to lightly spray it with water. If the water beads on the surface, the stone and/or grout is still in good condition. If the water is absorbed, sealer should be reapplied properly.</p>"
