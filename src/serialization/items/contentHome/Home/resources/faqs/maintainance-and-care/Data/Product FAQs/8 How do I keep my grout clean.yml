        <p>Grout, like stone, is a porous material. Maintaining a sealed product is important to keep your product looking new for a longer period of time. The Tile Shop offers two great neutral pH cleaners for general upkeep. Neutral pH cleaners are non-acidic and are important because acid could potentially etch polished stone and/or strip sealers. Our <a href="/products/superior-grout-and-tile-neutral-cleaner-1-quart-021650" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grout and Tile Neutral Cleaner</a> and Anti-Bacterial Cleaner&nbsp;are considered safe for daily use on your grout surfaces. The Tile Shop offers several additional products if your grout requires more heavy-duty cleaning. Consult with a Tile Shop representative to determine the best product for your application since some tile products may be acid/chemical-sensitive.</p>
