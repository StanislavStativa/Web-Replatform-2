      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>Yes, ceramic and porcelain tiles are environmentally friendly because they are:</p><ul><li>Low maintenance products, making them easy to clean with just water instead of harsh chemicals or cleaners that are often needed to treat or clean other flooring options.</li><li>Fired in kilns to extremely high temperatures, eliminating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from finished products. VOCs contribute to a wide variety of health problems, making ceramic and porcelain tiles a better option for maintaining/improving indoor air quality.</li><li>Inhospitable to dust mites, mold, germs and bacteria when sealed and maintained properly. Tile is often used to replace carpet for people with allergies and asthma.</li><li>Sustainable. Ceramic and porcelain tiles are some of the longest lasting flooring products on the market, making them longer lasting than carpet, vinyl, or laminate flooring when they're properly installed and maintained.</li></ul><p><br /></p>"
