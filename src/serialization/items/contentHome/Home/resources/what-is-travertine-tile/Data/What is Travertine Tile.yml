        <h1>What is Travertine Tile?</h1>
        <h6>Last Updated: 08/02/2019</h6>
        <br />
        What is travertine tile? Travertine is a type of limestone that is formed by mineral deposits from natural springs. This sedimentary stone is created by a rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate, known as calcite. Other minerals mix together with the calcite to create unique swirls and movement that give travertine its distinctive character.<br /><br />

        <h4><br />Travertine Finishes</h4>
        <br />
        <p><a href="/material/travertine">Travertine</a> is a versatile product choice as it has many different finishes to help you achieve the look you are going for.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Polished</strong>:&nbsp;Create a look of luxury with the high shine from polished travertine. Polished travertine is smoothed and glossed over to get a shiny reflective surface.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Honed</strong>: Honed finishes provide a smooth yet matte finish without any shine. Honed travertine can either be filled or unfilled. A honed look and texture is achieved by grinding and buffing one side of the unfinished stone.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Brushed</strong>: Utilize the natural look of travertine with a brushed finish. This textured finish features an unfilled exterior and provides a rustic yet sophisticated look. This look is obtained by brushing the surface of the stone with a brush or wire wheel until the preferred texture is achieved.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Tumbled</strong>: To create tumbled travertine, pieces of stone are cut, sized and placed in a rubber coated or plastic barrel with an abrasive grit and water. Sometimes a small amount of acid is mixed in. The tub/barrel is turned over and over again, allowing for the stones to rub against each other. The edges of the travertine are softened and worn down. This feature provides a much more natural, worn look. Like brushed travertine, tumbled travertine has a high-textured finish. The major difference between the two is that tumbled travertine has softened edges.</p>
        <br />
        <p>DIY Installation tip: Tumbled travertine should be sealed before and after grouting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
