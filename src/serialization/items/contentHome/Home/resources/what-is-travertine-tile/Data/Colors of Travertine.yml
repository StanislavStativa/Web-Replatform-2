        <p><br />Because travertine is a natural stone, it may have a high variation in coloration and movement. High variation means no two projects will ever be the same, even if the same stone is used. It’s important to lay out your tile in the design you desire before it is installed to ensure you get the look you want.</p><p><br /></p>

        <h3><br />Is it often installed in certain rooms?</h3>
        <p>Travertine is a common natural stone that is used in bathrooms. Unpolished travertine stone has a naturally nonslip texture.

        <h3><br />Durability</h3>

Be conscious of the finish you choose and what kind of area you’re installing it in.&nbsp;Like other natural stone, travertine can lengthen its timeless beauty with proper installation and maintenance. </span><span style="color: black;">Proper installation plays a large part in the durability of travertine.<br /> </span></p><p><br /></p>
