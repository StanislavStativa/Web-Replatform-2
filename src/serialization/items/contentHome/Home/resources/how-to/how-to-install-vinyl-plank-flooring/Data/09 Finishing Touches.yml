        <p>Once all the planks are in place, there are a few final tasks before your vinyl plank flooring installation is complete.</p><br />
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>First, install transition strips where the vinyl plank flooring meets other types of flooring or doorways. Use silicone adhesive to secure them in place.</li>
            <li>Next, carefully reinstall the baseboards using finishing nails. Ensure they cover any gaps left between the planks and the wall.</li>
            <li>Finally, go over the entire floor with a 100-lb. floor roller, first along one direction, then in the perpendicular direction. Using the roller is advised no matter what type of vinyl planks you have installed. This will help remove any air bubbles in the adhesive and will ensure all the planks are settled and smooth.</li>
        </ul><p />
