        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>Use your measuring tape to determine the width of the room, including any alcoves or protrusions. This measurement will help you calculate the width of the first and last rows of planks, ensuring a balanced and symmetrical appearance.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Next, divide the room width by the width of a single vinyl plank. This calculation will help you determine how many planks will fit across the width of the room. If the last row is less than half a plank's width, cut the first row of planks to a narrower width.</p>
        <br />
        <p>When your measurements are complete, use a chalk line or a straightedge and a pencil to mark a reference line along the length of the starting wall. This line will serve as a guide for laying the first row of planks. Take your time to make sure this line is perfectly straight across the entire wall to avoid plank alignment problems later on. </p>
