        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>Some vinyl planks come with an attached underlayment, while others require a separate underlayment material. If you need to add underlayment, the first step is to ensure that the subfloor is free from any debris, dust, or imperfections.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In some cases, especially for installations on concrete subfloors, a moisture barrier may be required to prevent moisture from seeping up into the flooring. This is a layer placed in addition to the underlayment specifically designed to protect the flooring from moisture-related damage. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for installing a vapor barrier if it's recommended.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Roll out or lay down the underlayment sheets or rolls across the entire subfloor. Ensure that the edges of adjacent sheets overlap according to the manufacturer's instructions. This helps create a continuous and uniform underlayment surface. Use a utility knife or scissors to trim excess underlayment material along the walls or at obstacles.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Secure the underlayment in place, following any recommended methods provided by the manufacturer. This may involve using adhesive, staples, or tape, depending on the underlayment type.</p>
