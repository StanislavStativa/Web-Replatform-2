        Allow grout to set for the amount of time specified in the manufacturer's directions, usually 15 to 30 minutes, then begin gently wiping off the excess grout with a clean, damp sponge. Rinse the sponge frequently, using one bucket for getting the excess grout off the sponge and the other for re-dampening the sponge. Be sure to replace the water in both buckets frequently to keep it from getting too dirty. As you wipe, be careful not to remove grout from the joints.</p>
        <p>
        After approximately 30 minutes, you can use a grout shaper to trim excess grout from the edges of the tiles. This will give the grout a crisp, professional look.</p>

        Once the grout is mixed, it's time to apply it to the joints. Gather a dollop of grout onto your grout float and position the float against the tile at a 45-degree angle. Spread the grout into the joints using firm, diagonal strokes. You will need to go over the entire area multiple times to ensure the grout has fully filled all the joints.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you are finished, pull the grout float diagonally across the surface to remove as much excess grout as possible. This will make cleaning up much simpler.
