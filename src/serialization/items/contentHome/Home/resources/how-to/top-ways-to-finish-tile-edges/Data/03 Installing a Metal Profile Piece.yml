        <p>Metal profile pieces are a popular choice for protecting delicate tile edges while creating a streamlined transition from tile to another surface, such as drywall. They are commonly offered with either rounded or squared edges, and come in a range of metal tones and finishes, making it easy to coordinate with the other fixtures in a room.. </p>

        <p>Unlike bullnose tile and pencil-shaped trim pieces, metal profile pieces are installed before you set your final row of tile. Only a portion of metal trim is visible after installation. The narrow edge side provides a visually pleasing finish to a tiled area, while the “leg” of the piece—the wide, flat part with triangle cut-outs—lays flush with the wall, securely embedded underneath the tile.</p>

        <p>Metal profile edging is sold in long pieces, so you will need to cut it to size. For safety reasons, our preferred tool for cutting metal edging is a miter box and hacksaw, but a <a href="/products/cortag-zapp-600-127-v-electric-wet-saw-10-in.-60347">wet saw</a> can also be used.</p>
