            <li>Apply thinset to wall using notched side of trowel. Notches should run parallel to the shortest tile edge.</li>
            <li>Embed the leg of the metal trim piece all the way into the thinset. Press down, moving slightly back and forth, until thinset comes through the triangular cutouts.</li>

The tile will be installed on top of this piece." src="http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TileShop/TTC_Finish_Tile_Edges_9:16x9" />Tip: Use the edge of a margin trowel to press down on the leg, if needed.</p>

            <li>Apply additional thinset to the back of your tile in the area where the profile will sit behind the tile. This ensures there is ample thinset to cover the metal, and the tile will securely adhere to the wall.</li>

        <p>
            </p><li>Apply tile to wall, embedding into the thinset. Use a wet sponge to wipe the surface of the tile clean.</li>

A piece of metal profile trim is already embedded in the thinset, so the edge of the completed installation will have a clean, finished look." src="http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TileShop/TTC_Finish_Tile_Edges_14:16x9" />
            <li>Insert spacers to ensure proper distance for grout joints. Tip: Insert tile wedges between profile trim and tiles to create a narrow space for grout. This adds a uniform appearance to your finished installation.</li>
