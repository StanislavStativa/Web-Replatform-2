        If you are grouting a large area, start by mixing only a small portion of grout. This will ensure your supply of grout stays moist and usable and does not dry out and become crumbly.</p>
        <p>Pour a portion of grout powder into a clean, empty bucket then mix it with the right ratio of water according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mix it slowly by hand using a trowel until it has a smooth, peanut butter-like consistency with no dust or excess water left in the bucket.</p>
        <p>
        Next, allow the grout to slake for the amount of time specified in the manufacturer's directions. When this slake time has passed, mix it again slightly to loosen the grout. Once you have loosened it, you should immediately start applying it to ensure the batch does not dry out.</p>
