        Allow grout to set for the amount of time specified in the manufacturer's directions, usually 15 to 30 minutes, then begin gently wiping off the excess grout with a clean, damp sponge. Rinse the sponge frequently, using one bucket for getting the excess grout off the sponge and the other for re-dampening the sponge. Be sure to replace the water in both buckets frequently to keep it from getting too dirty. As you wipe, be careful not to remove grout from the joints.</p>

        After approximately 30 minutes, you can use a grout shaper to trim excess grout from the edges of the tiles. This will give the grout a crisp, professional look.</p>
