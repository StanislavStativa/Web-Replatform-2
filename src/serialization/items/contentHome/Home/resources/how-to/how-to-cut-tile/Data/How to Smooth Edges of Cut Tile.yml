      Value: |
        <p>Whether you cut tile using a wet saw, snap cutter or angle grinder, you will end up with some sort of imperfection or chipping on the cut edge of your tile. Even tile pros need to go back and polish the cut edges of every cut they make. </p>
        <br />
        <p>In the image above, the factory edge is on the right, and the cut edge of the tile is on the left. In the close-up, some chipping in the glaze is visible.</p>
        <br />
        <p>To smooth cut edges, you can use a variable speed angle grinder with diamond polishing pads, held at a 45-degree angle to the glazed edge.</p>
        <br />
        <p>If you do not have a variable speed angle grinder, diamond polishing hand pads (available at most hardware and home improvement stores) will provide the same result.</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>When smoothing tile edges by hand, DO position the pad at a 45-degree angle to the glazed edge of the tile, in one direction only.</li>
            <li>DON&rsquo;T smooth on a perpendicular angle or scrape the pad back and forth, as this can cause more chipping.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>When you&rsquo;re finished, the cut edge will look as close to the factory edge as possible.</p>
