        <p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll demonstrate how to use a snap cutter to cut glass tile, ceramic tile and porcelain tile. The only tile you cannot cut on a snap cutter is natural stone.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Snap cutters are very versatile tools, because they are relatively lightweight and easy to carry around, set up and break down, and you can work with virtually no dust&mdash;or mess&mdash;right next to your job site.</p>
        <br />
        <p>There are many different versions of snap cutters on the market, but all of them have virtually the same components: they&rsquo;ll have a cutting wheel, rails (usually two, but sometimes a single rail), and a handle so you can apply pressure.</p>
