        <p>However you plan to cut your vinyl planks, it's important to have the right safety gear. Always wear work gloves and safety glasses when making cuts. When using a jigsaw, wear a dust mask.</p>
        <p class="rtc__list-item-with-image mt-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="margin-left: 40px;">For Straight Cuts</h3>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="margin-left: 40px;">Place the vinyl plank on a table with the section to be removed hanging over the edge. Position the plank with the table's edge near the cutting line to avoid any bending or snapping in the wrong place. Firmly hold the side on the table in place and apply gentle pressure to the other side to snap the plank along the scored line.</p>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="margin-left: 40px;">You can also make a straight cut by placing the plank directly on the floor. For this method, put one knee on the larger side of the plank to hold it in place and pull up on the smaller side to snap the plank in half.</p>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="margin-left: 40px;">For either method, the plank should break cleanly. If there are any uneven edges, lightly run the utility knife along the edge to smooth it out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="margin-left: 40px;">For Irregular Cuts</h3>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="margin-left: 40px;">There are a few ways to make irregular cuts in your vinyl plank flooring. No matter which method you use, you should start by securing the plank to a table or other work surface using clamps. This will keep it from slipping as you work.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
            <li class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Utility knife.&nbsp;</strong>Use masking tape to secure the template to your vinyl plank. Slowly run the blade along the marked line. If you go too quickly you risk cutting outside the demarcated cutting line and marring your plank. Once you have made a few passes and have a sufficiently scored cutting line, apply more and more pressure until you have cut all the way through the plank.</li>
            <li class="extra-small-bottom-margin" style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Jigsaw.&nbsp;</strong>Drill a pilot hole or cut a notch at the edge of the plank where you will start cutting. Using a fine tooth blade, insert the jigsaw into the hole or notch and carefully guide it along the cutting line. Keep steady pressure on the jigsaw as you trace the cutting line until you reach the other side of the plank. To ensure an accurate cut, keep the jigsaw flat against the plank.</li>
        </ul>
