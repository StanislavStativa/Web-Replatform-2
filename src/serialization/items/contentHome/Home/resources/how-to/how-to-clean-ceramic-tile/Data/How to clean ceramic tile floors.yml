        <h3>Step 1. Sweep</h3>
        <br />
        <p>Start by removing loose dirt and debris. Sweep or vacuum your tile floors regularly to prevent dirt and grit from scratching the surface.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 2. Mop With Water</h3>
        <br />
        <p>Once the loose debris is removed, mop the floor with warm water. For tiles that are regularly maintained, this will be enough to restore their shine.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 3. Dry Thoroughly</h3>
        <br />
        <p>You can allow the floor to air dry, but leaving excess moisture on the tiles can lead to unsightly water spots. For a more polished look, use a microfiber cloth to dry the ceramic tiles thoroughly.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 4. Use Tile Cleaner for Deep Cleaning</h3>
        <br />
        <p>For tougher stains or built-up grime, you may need to mop with a mild cleaning solution. Mix warm water with a <a href="/installation-care/care-maintenance/cleaners">pH-neutral cleaner</a> specifically designed for ceramic tile. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, which are likely to damage the tile.
