        <h3><br />Step 1. Daily Care<br />​</h3>
        <p>To minimize water spots and reduce the buildup of minerals from water, use a squeegee on the tiles after each shower. It is also helpful to ensure proper ventilation during and after showers to reduce the humidity, which promotes mold and mildew growth.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 2. Rinse Away Dirt<br />​</h3>
        <p>Start by removing loose dirt and other debris from the ceramic tiles. You can do this by rinsing the shower walls with warm water. </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 3. Spray With a Specialized Cleaner<br />​</h3>
        <p>Use a non-abrasive, <a href="/installation-care/care-maintenance/cleaners">pH-neutral cleaner</a> suitable for ceramic tiles. Make a mixture of tile cleaner and water and put it in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously on the tiles and let it sit for a few minutes to break down soap scum and oils.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 4. Scrub the Tiles Gently<br />​</h3>
        <p>Use a soft-bristled brush or non-scratching scrubbing pad to gently scrub the tiles and grout. Pay extra attention to areas with significant soap scum buildup or mildew.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Step 5. Rinse and Dry<br />​</h3>
        <p>Rinse the shower walls and floor with clean water to remove any remaining cleaner and loosened debris. You can use a handheld showerhead or a bucket for this. Finally, dry the shower with a dry towel or squeegee.</p>
