        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">Once you have all the tools and materials you need, the next step is to start planning the layout of your design. This is an important step because once you start installing tile, it&rsquo;s hard to go back and rethink the layout.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">First, find the center of the room. The easiest way to do this is to measure the length of one wall and divide that number in half. Next, measure the opposite wall and divide that number in half. Then, draw a line on the floor connecting the two center points. Repeat this process with the other two walls. You should now have two lines that intersect at the center point of the room.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">To plan your layout, you&rsquo;ll first place tiles on the ground without adhesive. Start from the center point and lay a row of tiles (including spacers) in one direction. You don&rsquo;t want to end with a sliver cut (less than half of a tile) at the end of the row. Shift your starting point if your row ends with less than half a tile.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">Next, lay another row of tiles at a 90&deg; angle from the first, and adjust your layout if you encounter a sliver cut. Be sure to account for any design features you are incorporating in your layout, such as diagonal tile, unique pattern or tiled border.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">Once you have decided on the tile layout, plan the order in which you will tile each section of the room. Make sure to finish in front of a door so you can easily exit without stepping on the tiles. If you are tiling walls and floors, we recommend starting with floors so that your<a href="/application/wall">&nbsp;wall tile</a>&nbsp;will overlap and sit on top of the floor tile. This ensures that water will run onto the floor tile instead of into the grout joint or under the tile.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">The consistency and timing of your thinset are vital to a successful installation. For the best results, you want to know the open time and cure time of your thinset.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">Open time is the amount of time you have to work with your thinset before it hardens&mdash;typically between 30-40 minutes, but the timing can vary by type of thinset, temperature, humidity and other factors.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">To determine if your thinset is still usable, dip your finger in the bucket, if the thinset doesn&rsquo;t stick to your finger, it&rsquo;s past its prime. Toss the expired tinset, clean your bucket and mix up a fresh bash to continue with your project.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">Cure time is the amount of time it takes for thinset to fully set once it&rsquo;s installed. Refer to the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations for cure times.</p>
