        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">It&rsquo;s important to have the right surface prepared before you start to tile. Determine your existing subfloor and adjoining floor height, and whether you want to include in-floor heating. This will help you decide which underlayment will work best for your project.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25in;">You&rsquo;ll want to ensure you are working on a clean, dry surface. Thoroughly sweep and vacuum your space before you install your underlayment.</p>
        <p>There are many different versions of snap cutters on the market, but all of them have virtually the same components: they&rsquo;ll have a cutting wheel, rails (usually two, but sometimes a single rail), and a handle so you can apply pressure.</p>
