        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>
        <span class="normaltextrun">Before the grout dries, clean up the excess grout. Use a damp sponge (not dripping wet) to wipe diagonally across the tiles, removing the excess without digging into the joints. Rinse and re-wring your sponge frequently. After the grout has had more time to firm up (usually a few hours), polish away any remaining haze from the tile surface with a clean, dry cloth.<br />
        <br />
        Next, fill the expansion gap with <a class="font-bold" href="/installation-care/installation/caulk">tile caulk</a>. You can also add tile caulk to the corners where the tile meets the wall and where the tile meets the cabinets for a more finished look.<br />
        <br />
        For added protection against stains and moisture, apply a grout sealer after 24-48 hours. Follow the sealer's instructions for application and drying time.</span>
