        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>Starting on the back wall, measure across left to right. Divide that measurement by the tile size plus the spacer size. This will tell you how many full tiles will fit along your back wall.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>Next, find your center point on the back wall and either start a full tile from that center line or place a grout joint at that center line.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>If you are doing a pattern, like the offset brick-lay pattern (running bond) for this demonstration, you will want to make sure the layout works for that specific pattern. Since we are doing an offset brick-lay pattern that alternates tile positions every other row, I will be checking how the layout falls for two rows of tile.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Using a level, position your ledger board for your first row of tile, starting at least one tile&rsquo;s height up from the base of your shower. Note where your wall studs are, and screw into studs along the ledger board.</p>

        <br />
        <div class="rtc__callout-text">
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: After removing your ledger board, remember to waterproof the holes with waterproof sealant before you install the final row of tile.</p>
