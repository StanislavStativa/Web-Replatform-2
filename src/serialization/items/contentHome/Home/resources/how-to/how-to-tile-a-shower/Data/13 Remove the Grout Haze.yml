        <p>Once your initial clean is complete, your shower will end up with a sort of film on the surface. This film is called &ldquo;grout haze.&rdquo;</p>
        <br />
        <p>

        <br />
        <p>To remove the grout haze from your tiles,&nbsp; grab two buckets of water, a clean sponge, and a dry microfiber towel.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="rtc__callout-text">
        <p>After years of practice removing grout haze, my best tip is to use two buckets during this step: one for dirty water, and one for clean. To keep the water in the second bucket clean, <strong>I only wring my sponges out over the dirty water bucket</strong>.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: I dunk my dirty sponge in the dirty water bucket and wring it out. Then, I dunk the same sponge in the clean water bucket and wring that excess water out over the dirty water bucket, too. <strong>This ensures I am only applying clean water to my walls, which cuts down on the grout haze</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <br />
        <p>Begin cleaning by using a damp sponge on the surface of your tile. Follow up each section that you have sponged with a dry microfiber. Repeat until all walls are complete.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Once all walls are cleaned and dry, you should be able to see if all grout haze has been removed. If you have stubborn grout haze, you can follow up with a <a class="font-bold" href="/products/superior-haze-remover-tile-cleaner-1-quart-022220">grout haze remover</a>.</p>
