        Allow grout to set for the amount of time specified in the manufacturer's directions, usually 15 to 30 minutes, then begin gently wiping off the excess grout with a clean, damp sponge. Rinse the sponge frequently, using one bucket for getting the excess grout off the sponge and the other for re-dampening the sponge. Be sure to replace the water in both buckets frequently to keep it from getting too dirty. As you wipe, be careful not to remove grout from the joints.</p>
        <p>
        After approximately 30 minutes, you can use a grout shaper to trim excess grout from the edges of the tiles. This will give the grout a crisp, professional look.</p>

        <p>When you are done with demolition you will be left with bare studs. These studs play an important role when tiling a shower, and we want to make sure they are all flat and free of high or low spots before hanging our tile backerboard. Not doing so can lead to lippage in our tile installation.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>Here is what you need to do to get flat walls for tiling your shower:</p>
        <br />
        <h3><span class="h3-style">Check Studs</span></h3>
        <br />
        <p>Check each stud (up and down) using a level. Make sure you are using at least a 5-ft. level. It&rsquo;s even better if the level is the length of the stud itself.</p>
        <br />
        <img class="rtc__list-item-with-image__image" alt="Using a level to check all the studs in a shower wall before tiling." src="https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TileShop/TTC_Tile_a_shower_Wall_Prep5:16x9" />
        <br />
        <p>You will want to check along the length of the wall for any studs that are out of plane with your straight edge.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>If tiling to a tub (like in this example) you will want to also make sure that all studs are touching the top of the tub flange.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <h3><span class="h3-style">Align Studs</span></h3>
        <br />
        <p>If any studs are out of plane or not touching the top of your tub flange, you will need to sister studs together. To do this, simply screw a new stud to the existing stud while making sure the new stud is touching the back of the tub flange or in plane with your other studs.</p>
