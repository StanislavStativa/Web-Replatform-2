        <div class="rich-text">
        <p>Tiling a shower can be a messy job. If you are doing the demolition of your old shower tile yourself, you will want to make sure you protect the work area.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Shut off your AC/HEAT, lay down tarps and floor protection along the walking path, and hang plastic over surfaces where you don&rsquo;t want fine dust to settle.</p>
        <br />
        <p>If tiling over a tub space, you may want to protect the surface of your tub with a tarp, tub protector, or piece of plywood to avoid chipping and damaging your tub surface.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>Finally, make sure you always wear appropriate protective equipment, like a mask, gloves and eyewear, for your safety when performing the demo of your bathroom.</p>
