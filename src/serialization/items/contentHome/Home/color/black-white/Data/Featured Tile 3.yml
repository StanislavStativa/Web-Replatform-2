        <div class="rich-text"><p>
        <span>, you want to be sure the investment of time and money will result in a space you’re pleased with for years to come. That means choosing tile and other finishes that will make your space look up to date now, but not dated in the future. Kitchens are another room where the pairing of black and white offers a world of design possibilities that will stand the test of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
        
        </p>
        <br />
        
        <p><span></span><span>Kitchens are also spaces where small changes can make a big difference. If you want to do a “refresh” rather than a full renovation, consider adding a black and white tile backsplash. The pairing of these high-contrast neutrals can deliver the before-and-after magic of a major kitchen update in a fraction of the time, and transform the look of the whole space.&nbsp;</span></p>
