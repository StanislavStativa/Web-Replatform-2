        <h2><span class="h3-style">Where to Use Ivory Tiles</span></h2>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h4-style">Bathrooms</span></h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The light, off-white color of ivory tiles serves a dual purpose when used to decorate a bathroom. First, these tiles reflect light effectively, making the bathroom feel larger and brighter. This is especially beneficial for smaller bathrooms where maximizing the feeling of space is important. Second, ivory evokes a sense of cleanliness. This combination has made ivory bathroom tiles a perennial favorite.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h4-style">Kitchens</span></h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Installing ivory backsplash tile can add a subtle elegance to your kitchen without overwhelming the overall design. To keep things even more simple and subdued, consider the classic look of ivory subway tile. If you're looking for something with a little more texture, <a href="https://www.tileshop.com/featured/mosaics"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mosaic tile</span></strong></a> can add visual interest. No matter what style you choose, an ivory backsplash allows you to explore a wide range of design options elsewhere in the kitchen, creating a balanced, cohesive look.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h4-style">Entryways</span></h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When used in an entryway, ivory floor tiles greet your visitors with a fresh, welcoming look. These off-white floor tiles easily enhance the glow of sunlight, giving a sense of lightness to a space without being overwhelmingly brilliant. This effect is even more impactful for entryways that do not get a significant amount of natural light, making them feel more spacious and relaxed. On a practical note, ivory tiles add brightness to this high-traffic area while camouflaging dirt and dust better than a stark white.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h4-style">Outdoor Spaces</span></h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As a color, ivory tends to enhance the light around it, which makes it a popular choice for <a href="https://www.tileshop.com/room/outdoor/patio-floor"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">outdoor spaces like patios</span></strong></a> and balconies. For areas dominated by sunlight, ivory's lighter tone will help keep surfaces cooler compared to darker materials. Spaces that are shadier will benefit from the natural brilliance of these bright tiles. And the use of outdoor-friendly tile means keeping your backyard hangout clean will always be quick and easy.</p>
