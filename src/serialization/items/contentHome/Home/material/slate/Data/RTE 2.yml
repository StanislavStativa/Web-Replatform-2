        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">A Variety of Shapes for Interest and Movement</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>In mid-century home design, it was common to see freeform slate pieces, arranged so that they generally fit together, used as floor or wall coverings. But if that classic no-pattern pattern is the only way you’ve seen slate tile used, you’re in for a pleasant surprise.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Our selection includes a wide variety of shapes ranging from square to subway to hexagon, as well as many <a href="/featured/mosaics" class="font-bold">mosaic styles</a>. You’ll also find slate mosaic tiles, including brick-look, starburst designs and the customer-favorite Versailles (a best-selling arrangement of squares and rectangles available in multiple sizes and colors).</p>

        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Where Can You Use Slate Tiles</h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>The short answer is, (nearly) anywhere with floors or walls! Here are just a few of our favorite places to install slate tile:</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Bathroom</h4>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>While it's suited to floors or walls, slate bathroom tile has long been a favorite for <a href="/room/bathroom/floor" class="font-bold">bathroom floors</a> in particular, thanks to the underfoot traction its natural texture provides.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Entryway/Mudroom</h4>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Slate is durable enough to hold up to snow, mud and rain, and as a natural material, it creates a beautiful transition between the inside and outside of your home.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Outdoor Spaces</h4>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Depending on your climate zone and specific features of your outdoor space, outdoor slate tile might be an option for your <a href="/room/outdoor/patio-floor" class="font-bold">backyard patio</a>, garden path and more.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
