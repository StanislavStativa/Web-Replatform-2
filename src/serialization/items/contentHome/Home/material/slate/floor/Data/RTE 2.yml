        <h3><span>A Variety of Shapes for Interest and Movement</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Slate is often associated with freeform pieces of natural stone arranged so that they generally fit together. (This style was especially popular for entryway flooring in mid-century homes.) However, our selection includes slate floor tiles in shapes like square, subway, hexagon and more. We also offer several </span><a href="/featured/mosaics?facet_material=facet_idU2xhdGU*" class="font-bold">mosaic styles</a><span>, including brick-look, and Versailles (a best-selling arrangement of squares and rectangles available in multiple sizes and colors, and the ideal no-pattern pattern for any room).  </span></p>
