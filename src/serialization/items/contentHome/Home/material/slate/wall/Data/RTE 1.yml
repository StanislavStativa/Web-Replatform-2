        <h2>Why We Love Natural Slate Wall Tile</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>The walls of your home are a blank canvas; turn yours into a masterpiece with slate wall tiles. If you’ve only seen slate tiles used to cover floors and <a href="/room/outdoor/patio-wall" class="font-bold">patios</a>, you might not know what a beautiful addition slate tiles can be to the walls of your home.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Natural stone materials, like slate, offer you the chance to create a truly one-of-a-kind space, because no two pieces of natural stone are ever the same. This organic variation is a result of how the stone forms inside the earth, and you’ll appreciate the depth and texture of your slate wall tiles for years to come.</p>

        <p /><h3><span class="h3">Slate Isn't Just Grey!</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>As a color name, “slate” typically refers to medium to dark shades of bluish grey, but slate (the natural stone material) is found in a variety of colors. Our collection of <a href="/material/slate/floor" class="font-bold">natural slate floor tiles</a> comprises a range of shades, from moody shades of charcoal and black; earthy browns, dark greens and reddish hues; and much lighter shades, like tan and <a href="/color/beige" class="font-bold">beige</a>.</p>

        <p /><h3>Eye-Catching Shapes to Enhance Your Space</h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Midcentury home design often featured slate tile floors or walls made up of freeform pieces of natural stone arranged so that they generally fit together. Like all things midcentury, this look is still popular today, but there are more options than ever when it comes to tile shape.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">At The Tile Shop, our selection of slate wall tiles includes shapes like square, subway, hexagon  and more.
