        <p>
        Ceramic and porcelain are both man-made tiles that are produced from firing clay or other materials. The main difference is determined by the genetic makeup of the tile bisque. The size of the grain and temperature of the kiln will determine the strength of the tile. Some ceramics are stronger than porcelains and vice versa, so it’s all about where the tile is being installed and the look you are going for.
