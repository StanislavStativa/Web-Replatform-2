        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Stunning Natural Stone: Travertine Floor Tiles</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Travertine tile has remained a popular flooring choice for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, thanks to its timeless look and natural durability. That’s great news for today’s homeowners, too; if you also select travertine floor tiles for your next project, you can look forward to enjoying your space for many years to come. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Another likely reason for travertine’s enduring popularity is the variety of finishes (i.e., surface textures) available, depending on how a piece of stone is treated after cutting. This variety means that if you’re designing, for example, a travertine tile bathroom, you can choose travertine floor tiles as well as <a href="/material/travertine/wall" class="font-bold">travertine wall tile</a>, and just by varying the finish, each surface will have a distinct look. Travertine floor tiles are available in the following finishes: </p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Tumbled Travertine </h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>As travertine forms in the earth, it develops holes and other negative space that lends even newly cut slabs a textured, antique appearance. Tumbled travertine floor tiles play up this characteristic of the stone. Pieces of newly cut tile are literally tumbled in a machine with other rocks to very slightly soften and distress the surface and cut edges of the tile. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Brushed Travertine</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Brushed travertine tiles have a surface that is slightly more refined than tumbled travertine. A rotating wire brush is used to lightly smooth the tile, giving these products an appearance slightly more refined than their tumbled counterparts. Brushed travertine floor tiles are particularly popular for achieving a rustic, Mediterranean room aesthetic. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Honed Travertine</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Honed travertine floor tiles have a finish that is mostly smooth to the touch, but still matte in appearance. To produce this finish, holes in the surface of the stone are filled, after which the surface is ground and buffed. Travertine floor tiles are frequently chosen for use in bathrooms, because honed travertine bathroom tile still offers some underfoot traction when wet. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Polished Travertine</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Of all travertine tile finishes, polished takes the longest amount of time to achieve. The surface has a reflective appearance and feels smooth to the touch. Surface crevices have been filled in and polished to a glassy shine, and people often choose polished travertine floor tiles when they want to create a space with luxury and elegance to spare.  </span></p>
