      Hint: Description
      Value: <p>Any surface can be slippery when wet. It’s most dangerous when your feet are wet and the surface you step on is also wet. Polished and honed stones that are flat and smooth will be more slippery than our finishes that are brushed, filled and tumbled. Solve this issue by designing your floors so that you have some texture when you are coming in from outdoors and the shower/tub area. Introduce a lovely listello or a mosaic to break up your flooring design and add some grout line in those areas.</p>
