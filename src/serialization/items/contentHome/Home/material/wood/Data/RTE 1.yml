        <h2>Bring Your Space to Life With Wood Wall Tiles</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Wood wall coverings—like wainscoting, shiplap and paneling—have been used to decorate homes for thousands of years, but that doesn’t mean that a wood-tiled wall will make your space feel old-fashioned. In fact, one of the things we love most about modern wood wall tiles is the juxtaposition of reclaimed natural materials with modern designs and features like self-adhesive applications. When it comes to creating timeless interiors with organic charm, wood mosaic tiles are a versatile and modern choice.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p /><h3><span class="h3">Types of Wood Tiling for Walls</span></h3>
        <p>Our selection of wood tiling for walls includes multiple styles featuring contemporary shapes and finishes. From geometric mosaics made with reclaimed wood to <a href="/featured/3d" class="font-bold">3D architectural tile</a> made with recovered pieces of sunken cedar, these styles prove that wood wall coverings have come a long way since formal wainscoting, groovy 1970s paneling and more recent modern-farmhouse shiplap.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p /><h3><span class="h3">Where to Install Wood Wall Tiles</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Just like wood floors look great throughout a home, so do wood walls. Wood tiles can be used in a variety of wall applications. Cover an entire wall with a 3D design that makes a statement with texture while still being neutral, or focus on a smaller feature area, like a wood tile backsplash over the counter in your <a href="/room/bar" class="font-bold">home bar</a>. Wherever you decide to incorporate them into your home, wood wall tiles will add a distinctive element that instantly elevates the look of a room.</p>
