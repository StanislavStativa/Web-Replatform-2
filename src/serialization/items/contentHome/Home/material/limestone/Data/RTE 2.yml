        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">The Tile Shop’s experts travel the globe to source a truly world-class selection of limestone tiles that includes a wide range of colors, sizes and shapes, so you can see the best this material has to offer.</p>
        <h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h4">Shop by finish</span></h4>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Depending on how a piece of limestone is treated after cutting, a variety of finishes are possible. These include the rustic texture of tumbled limestone to the high shine of polished pieces—and everything in between.</p>
        <h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h4">Shop by Color</span></h4>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">From creamy shades of taupe and ivory to moody black and dark gray and a range of earthy brown tones, there’s a naturally occurring shade of limestone right for your space.</p>
        <h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h4">Shop by Shape</span></h4>
        <p class="extra-small-bottom-margin">We love the juxtaposition of a material from classical architecture with the clean lines and geometric shapes favored today, like clean and minimalist hexagons, <a href="/featured/subway?facet_material=facet_idTGltZXN0b25l" class="font-bold">classic subway tiles</a>, and eye-catching chevrons.</p>
        <h3 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Our Experts Can Help</span></h3>
