        <p>Limestone floor tiles have been used to create beautiful homes for thousands of years, but that doesn’t mean that choosing it for your floors will make your space look old-fashioned. Far from it! In fact, one of the things we love most about modern limestone flooring is the juxtaposition created by combining a material common in classical architecture with modern geometric shapes.  </p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>That’s why our selection of limestone floor tiles includes shapes like cobblestone, square, </span><a href="/featured/subway" class="font-bold">subway</a><span>, hexagon, and many more. We also offer several </span><a href="/material/limestone/mosaic" class="font-bold">limestone mosaic tile</a><span> options that include modern shapes like diamonds and chevrons, as well as our top-selling Versailles pattern (a popular arrangement of squares and rectangles available in multiple sizes and colors).  </span></p>
