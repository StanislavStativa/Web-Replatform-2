        <h2><span class="h2-style">Add Texture to Your Home with Quartzite Tiles</span></h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Quartzite tiles are a beautiful and durable natural stone option for flooring, walls and other surfaces, both interior and exterior. They are available in multiple finishes that range from highly polished to highly textured, and their natural variation and earthy colors add visual interest and unique flair wherever they are installed.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Quartzite tiles come in a rainbow of colors, ranging from white and taupe to shades of green and blue, all the way to deep black and even metallic colors. Whether you are looking for the clean, even look of square and rectangle tiles, the highly textured variety of <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.tileshop.com/shape/architectural">architectural tiles</a> or something even more unique, our selection of quartzite tiles has the shape for you.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <h2><span class="h2-style">Where to Use Quartzite Tiles</span></h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>Quartzite tiles are highly durable, which makes them ideal for any room in your home.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h3-style">Entryways</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Their scratch resistance means you can install quartzite floor tile in even your most high-traffic areas without worrying about wear or fading over time. This durability combines with moisture resistance to make quartzite tiles an especially good choice for <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.tileshop.com/inspiration/tile-ideas/entryway">entryway floors</a>, offering your guests a luxurious atmosphere when they arrive and freeing you from the worry of wear and tear from heavy foot traffic and the outdoor elements.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h3-style">In the Kitchen</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Quartzite is rated a 7 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it highly resistant to scratches, chips and cracks from everyday wear and tear, including knives and dropped utensils. When you also consider that its non-porous structure makes quartzite naturally mold and mildew resistant, it's clear that quartzite tiles are well suited for <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.tileshop.com/room/kitchen/backsplash">kitchen backsplashes</a>, floors and counters.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="h3-style">Around the Fireplace</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Quartzite tiles are made from natural stone with excellent heat resistance, so it's no wonder they are a popular choice for adorning <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.tileshop.com/room/fireplace">fireplaces</a>. Quartzite tiles are also relatively easy to clean and maintain; they can be wiped down with a damp cloth to remove soot and ash, and periodic sealing helps protect the surface from stains and moisture damage.</p>
