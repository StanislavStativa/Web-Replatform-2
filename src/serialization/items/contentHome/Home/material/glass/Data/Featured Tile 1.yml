        <p>Glass tiles are suitable for a wide variety of indoor and outdoor uses:</p><br /><br />
        <p><h4>Bathrooms</h4>
        <br />Our customers often end up selecting glass tile for bathroom projects. In addition to creating a sleek, clean look, glass is well suited to a humid environment and is easy to clean. It’s common for customers to select glass tile for multiple spaces within a single bathroom; for example, installing a glass tile shower as well as coordinating wall tile. Whether you’re shopping for materials for a powder room or grand primary ensuite, you can get the style and function you seek with glass tile.</p><br /><br />
        <p><h4>Kitchens</h4><br /><br />
        A glass tile backsplash is a smart addition to just about any kitchen. Glass holds up exceptionally well to heat and moisture, and as a non-porous material also resists staining (something any cook can appreciate!). If you’re updating your kitchen with resale value in mind, you’ll never go wrong with a glass subway tile backsplash, in particular. Subway tile is our best-selling shape across all product categories and offers the perfect blend of classic and on-trend style to bring your space up to date while ensuring it’s still in style many years down the road.</p><br /><br />
        <p><h4>Pools</h4><br />
        Glass tile looks gorgeous on the interior of a swimming pool, and can help enhance the light-catching properties of the water. Note: If you’re browsing for pool tile, always check with one of our team members to confirm whether a product is pool-rated before moving forward with your project.</p></div>
