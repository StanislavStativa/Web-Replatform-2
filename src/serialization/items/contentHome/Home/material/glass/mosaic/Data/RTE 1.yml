        <p>When you shop for glass mosaic tiles at The Tile Shop, the options are (practically) endless. The wide variety of colors, shapes and sizes makes them a gorgeous addition to any style of home décor.</p>
        
        <p>Here are a few of our favorite ways to help narrow your search and find the perfect fit for your project:</p>
        
        <p><h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Shop by color</h4>
        Sometimes “a rainbow of colors” is just a figure of speech, but glass mosaic tiles are available in a literal ROYGBIV assortment. Stick to a single color or, if the style you choose comes in multiple colorways, swap out individual mosaic pieces to create a one-of-a-kind installation.</p>
        
        <p><h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Shop by finish</h4>
        Glass comes in multiple finishes. Our collection of glass mosaic tiles includes designs with a single finish, as well as one that offer a combination of gloss, metallic, matte, frosted and more.</p>
        
        <p><h4 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Shop by shape</h4>
        From classic subway tile and trendy hexagons to unique shapes and specialty mosaics, glass tile offers something for everyone.</p></div>
