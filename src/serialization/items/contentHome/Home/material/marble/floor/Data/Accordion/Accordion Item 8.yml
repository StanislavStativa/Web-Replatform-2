      Hint: Description
      Value: <p>Marble and porcelain are very different materials. Marble is a natural stone, meaning that no two pieces will be the same. Porcelain is a manufactured material that can replicate the look but will never have the shade variation of the real thing. Porcelain is easier to maintain, but marble gives you that timeless look and feel. Choosing between porcelain and marble is all about what fits the needs of your space. The Tile Shop offers both materials in different price points that can work within any budget.</p>
