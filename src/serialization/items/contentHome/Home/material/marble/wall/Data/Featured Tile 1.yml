        <p><span>We think marble wall tiles look great in every room of a home, but there are two spaces where we see customers being especially happy with the results of installing marble wall tile: bathrooms and kitchens. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ul><li><strong>Bathrooms:</strong><span> Whether you want to create a spa-like sanctuary, or simply give a plain powder room a high-impact upgrade, adding marble wall tile to a bathroom is always a good move.

For instance, you could stagger </span><a href="/featured/subway" class="font-bold">subway tile</a><span> horizontally on the main walls, and vertically orient the same marble tile for shower walls.</span></li><li><span></span><strong>Kitchens:</strong><span> In the heart of your home, marble kitchen wall tiles can be used to achieve a variety of looks. We especially love exploring different marble finishes in the kitchen—brushed or tumbled tiles look more rustic and timeworn, while the more reflective surface of a polished marble wall tile adds an elegant, minimalist vibe.</span></li></ul></div>
