        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Choosing </span><a href="/application/wall" class="font-bold">wall tiles</a><span> is a big choice—after all, a room only has one floor, but it has four walls. It’s a highly visible surface in any space, so you want to feel confident in the tiles and design you choose. One question we hear a lot is how to strike a balance and choose a look that is timeless enough to look good in 10 or 20 years, but not so safe that it feels boring. For us, that means thinking about materials like marble; after all, homeowners have chosen marble tile for walls thousands of years, so it stands to reason it will still be appealing a few decades down the road. </span></p>
