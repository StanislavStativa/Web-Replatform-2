        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin">Get a Natural Look with Pebble Stone Tiles</h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>If you're looking to add a touch of nature and elegance to your home, you can't go wrong with pebble-stone tiles. Pebble stone tiles are incredibly versatile, coming in a variety of colors and designs ranging from muted beige and taupe to vibrant greens to multicolor mosaics and even moody charcoal grey.</p><p>These tiles are made with easy installation in mind. Each segment of pebbles is mounted on a mesh backing to make transportation and installation a breeze. While the arrangement of the pebble stones may look random, they are actually carefully arranged. Each sheet is made with a wavy edge so there are no seams when the tiles are placed side by side.</p>

        <h2 class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h2">Where to Use Pebbles and Stones</span></h2>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>The weathered, natural look of pebbles and stones are a fun way to add texture to just about any space in your home.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Shower Floors</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Smooth, dappled aesthetics of pebble stone tiles combine with the high traction of the grout that fills the spaces between them to make an absolutely ideal <a href="/room/bathroom/shower-floor" class="font-bold">shower floor</a>. Pebble stone shower floors are an enduring choice because they evoke a spa-like atmosphere while also providing slip-resistance. Just be sure to give your pebble shower floor tile a quick scrub with soapy water once a week to keep them nice and clean!</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;" class="extra-small-bottom-margin"><span class="h3">Kitchen Backsplashes</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the kitchen, pebble stone tiles can be used as a <a href="/room/kitchen/backsplash" class="font-bold">backsplash</a>. This is an especially appropriate surface material to place behind your sink, as the water-worn surface of the pebbles perfectly accentuates the running water from your faucet. Pebble mosaic tile is a wonderful way to add a bit of unexpected texture and style, placing material usually associated with the ground vertically on the wall for all to admire.</p>

        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">While bringing nature inside can be a dreamy way to decorate your home, sometimes nature wants to be <a href="/room/outdoor" class="font-bold">outside</a> too! Laying pebble floor tile in your backyard is an easy way to create a speckled stone path around your garden that is sure to stay in place and withstand year after year of seasonal elements.</p>
