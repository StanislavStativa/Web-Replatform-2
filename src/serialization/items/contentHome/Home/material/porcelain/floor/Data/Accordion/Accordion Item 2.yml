        Yes. Because of their strength, some porcelain floor tiles can be used outside the home for patios, gardens or pools. Make sure the tile is approved for exterior use before you begin because exterior tiles need to have special resistance to the weather. We also recommend stopping in at The Tile Shop to speak with an associate about your project as recommendations for tiles and installation will vary by environment and weather.
