        <p>There are very specific rules and guidelines to make sure your tile installation is strong enough on your specific type of floor. The different requirements for cement and plywood floors, as well as different joist spacing, mean that the combinations and installation methods vary greatly. Either refer to TCNA guidelines or come into <a href="/store-locator/" class="font-bold underline">The Tile Shop</a> to find out just how to install a porcelain floor that lasts.</p>
