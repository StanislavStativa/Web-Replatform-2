        <h3><span class="h3">Versatility of Applications</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>As a tile material, metal is a fun and surprising tile choice for lots of spaces in your home, from a metal mosaic tile bathroom accent to metal floor tiles and even ceiling details. This versatility allows for a creative way to tie multiple elements of the space together, with metal wall tiles tying into other metal fixtures and furnishings, unifying otherwise disparate elements throughout a space. You can even complete your installation with complementary metal edging for the perfect finishing touch.</p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <h3><span class="h3">Durability</span></h3>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>In any application, metal is known for its robust durability---and metal tiles are no exception. The strength and resilience of metal tiles make them a reliable option for a multitude of conditions. Unlike tiles made from softer materials, like porcelain or <a href="/material/ceramic" class="font-bold">ceramic</a>, metal tiles are much less likely to chip or crack, ensuring they maintain their appearance over time, no matter where they are installed.</p>
