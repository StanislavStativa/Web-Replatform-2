        The strength and durability are the biggest selling points of wood-look tile. You can achieve almost any look you would with real wood and, with unique shapes and colors, many more on top of that. A wood-look tile floor or wall lasts so long (and often costs less than wood) that is worth it in the long run. Additionally, your wood look never has to be refinished (perfect for homes with pets!), and it can be heated or get wet.
