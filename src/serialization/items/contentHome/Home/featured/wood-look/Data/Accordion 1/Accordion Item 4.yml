      Hint: Description
      Value: "<p>What pairs well with wood-look tile depends on the shape, the color, the look you want to achieve and, of course, your personal taste. If you are afraid of the design getting too busy, we would not recommend using a heavily patterned faux wood on the floor with another intricately patterned tile on the walls. The patterning of wood-look tiles varies from collection to collection, however, so you can usually find the perfect one to pair with another tile.</p>"
