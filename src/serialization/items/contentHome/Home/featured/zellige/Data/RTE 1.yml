        <div class="rich-text"><p /><h2 style="margin-bottom:0.67em;"><span class="h2">Embrace the Ancient Beauty of Zellige Tiles</span></h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0.67em;">These rough-hewn tiles are made by shaping, glazing and kiln-firing natural clay by hand, one piece at a time. The artistry that goes into crafting zellige tile can be seen in every individual piece. Each one has its own unique shape, color, and feel, connecting you to the artisan who created it. The result of this meticulous approach is an uncommonly charming and durable tile, so it's no wonder this process has gone almost unchanged for 1,000 years.</p>
