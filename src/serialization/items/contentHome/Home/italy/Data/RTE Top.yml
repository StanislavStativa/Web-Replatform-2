        <div class="rich-text"><p><center>Marble sourced from the mountains of Italy has been known as some of the finest in the world throughout history.<br />
        (<em>It was good enough for Michelangelo and David, after all.</em>)<br />
        That’s why we’ve taken the time and care to source only the finest and most beautiful Italian marble for our tiles.<br />
        Featuring the most stunning veining and coloring, this marble is truly the purest example of the stone.</center></p></div>
