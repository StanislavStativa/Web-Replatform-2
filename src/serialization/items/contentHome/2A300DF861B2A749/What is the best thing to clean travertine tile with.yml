        The best thing to clean travertine tile with is a solution of warm water and a mild, pH-neutral cleaner such as dish soap or commercial tile cleaner. Dish soap is a great choice because it's gentle and effective at removing everyday dirt and grime from travertine's surface. Commercial tile cleaners are even better at giving travertine tiles a thorough cleaning because they are specially formulated to clean and protect natural stone tiles without causing damage.
