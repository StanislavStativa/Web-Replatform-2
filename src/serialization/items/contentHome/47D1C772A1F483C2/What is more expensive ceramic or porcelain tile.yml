        <p>Not all porcelain tiles are more expensive than ceramic tiles, and not all ceramic tiles are less durable than porcelain tiles. Cost is only one factor, and it may or may not be the most helpful in determining which material is the best choice.</p>
        <p>If you are considering similar tiles in ceramic and porcelain, it is more likely that the porcelain tiles will be at a higher price point.</p>
        <p>As a category, porcelain tiles are more water resistant, durable and lower maintenance, especially in high traffic areas. Durability is an important consideration when trying to decide between porcelain vs ceramic floor tile, as ceramic tile is comparatively more prone to scratches. This can contribute to a higher cost, but the superior durability for high traffic areas may be worth the trade off.</p>
